3. **Full Control Layout (45/55 split)**
   - Maximum control and configuration options
   - Tab-based settings interface
   - Advanced camera and device settings

### Component System

The application uses a modular component architecture with:

- **CustomizableButton**: Flexible button component with theme awareness
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time system monitoring components
- **Recording Components**: Advanced recording with state management
- **Camera Components**: Camera integration and control
- **Settings Components**: Configuration and settings interface

### State Management

The application implements a sophisticated state management system using:

- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **StateFlow**: Reactive state management
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous operations
- **Lifecycle Awareness**: Proper lifecycle management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 21+
- Kotlin 1.5+
- Jetpack Compose 1.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
4. Build and run the application

### Basic Usage

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {
    CamConnectTheme {
        Surface(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
            color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
        ) {
            AdaptiveStreamLayout(context = LocalContext.current)
        }
    }
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive documentation

### Component Development

- Create reusable components
- Implement proper state hoisting
- Use composition over inheritance
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### State Management

- Use ViewModels for complex state
- Implement unidirectional data flow
- Handle lifecycle properly
- Optimize for performance

## Testing

### Component Testing

```kotlin
@Test
fun `test component behavior`() {
    // Component testing implementation
}
```

### State Testing

```kotlin
@Test
fun `test state transitions`() = runTest {
    // State testing implementation
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

- Implement proper cleanup in DisposableEffect
- Use MemoryManager for weak reference cleanup
- Cancel coroutines when components are disposed

### State Optimization

- Use remember and derivedStateOf for expensive computations
- Implement efficient state flow patterns
- Cache frequently accessed data

### UI Performance

- Use LazyColumn/LazyRow for large lists
- Implement proper recomposition optimization
- Use remember for expensive UI computations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Leaks**
   - Ensure proper cleanup in DisposableEffect
   - Cancel coroutines in onCleared()
   - Use MemoryManager.cleanupWeakReferences()

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Use StateFlow for reactive state
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Handle lifecycle events correctly

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Optimize recomposition with remember
   - Use lazy loading for large datasets
   - Implement efficient state updates

### Debug Tools

- Use Android Studio's Layout Inspector
- Monitor memory usage with Memory Profiler
- Use Compose Debug tools for UI inspection
